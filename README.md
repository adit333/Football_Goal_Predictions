# Football_Goal_Predictions
We will be predicting the number of goals scored by a English Premier League team in 2019/2020 season.

There is a detailed data analysis and visualization of the data so that we can better understand the sports statistics.
Then, we will go onto build 3 linear regression models followed by more visualization and analysis of the model performance.

This is a regression problem. and the following models are built:
1) Linear regression - R^2 of 58%

2) Ridge regression - R^2 of 61%

3) Random Forest - R^2 of 70%
